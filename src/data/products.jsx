    name: 'Paracetamol',
    description: 'Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used over-the-counter medication for pain relief and fever reduction. It is commonly employed to treat a variety of conditions, including headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. Paracetamol works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the brain, which are chemicals responsible for pain and inflammation.One of the key advantages of paracetamol is its relatively low risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is often recommended for individuals who cannot take NSAIDs due to conditions like stomach ulcers or bleeding disorders. However, it is crucial to adhere to the recommended dosage, as an overdose can lead to severe liver damage, which can be fatal. The maximum daily dose for an adult is typically 4,000 milligrams, but it is essential to read the specific instructions on the packaging or follow a healthcare professionals advice.Paracetamol is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, liquid suspensions, and suppositories, making it accessible for both adults and children. It is considered a first-line treatment for mild to moderate pain and is often included in combination medications for enhanced therapeutic effects. Cost per pill: $0.10.',

    name: 'Aspirin',
    description: 'Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a widely used over-the-counter medication with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. It is commonly employed to alleviate pain, reduce fever, and decrease inflammation. Conditions often treated with aspirin include headaches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, arthritis, and minor injuries. Additionally, aspirin is used in low doses to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in individuals with cardiovascular conditions due to its antiplatelet effects, which help prevent blood clots.Aspirin works by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is involved in the production of prostaglandins.
